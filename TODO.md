1. Fix lootbag despawn in multiplayer race condition
2. Record hit sounds
3. Add gear slot icons
4. Show item stats while you're dragging an item
5. Make it so dragging into overworld drops the item
6. Make a second world scene: Going to have to make the server player be in all scenes/adjust all the spawners to grab where the local player is..
