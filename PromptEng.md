Context:
I am building a game like RotMG In Godot 4.4.

Game Quirks: 
The world is 3D, and my Camera is a top-down view with rotation 0, -90, 0. The camera is rotated by changing the rotation y value.

Style guidelines:
Do not write defensive code (don't do any null checks). Write code as concise as possible (do not declare variables when one-liners suffice).
